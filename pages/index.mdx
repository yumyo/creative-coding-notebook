# A Playground for Code, Art, and Coding Insights

Here, I explore the boundaries of art and technology through interactive sketches, generative design, and CSS experiments. 

Alongside these explorations, I document my journey in a weekly log—sharing what I’m working on, lessons learned, and a curated list of links to resources that I find relevant.
